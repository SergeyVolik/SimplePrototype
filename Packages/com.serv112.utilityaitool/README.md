# Introduction
It's the utility ai tool graph that base on a [Utility system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_system) concepts. The main idea of the utility ai is to create an AI based on different types of curves. Here is some introduction videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCf1GdRrerw&t=1528s. My goal is to create a comfortable graphical tool for ECS and MonoBehaviour using  [Graphtools Foundation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.graphtools.foundation@0.2/manual/index.html) for graph visualization and [Dataflow Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.dataflowgraph@0.15/manual/index.html) for fast math computations.
